### Theory

Aggregation relationship:

In Object-Oriented programming, an Object communicates to another object to use functionality and services provided by that object.

-  If a class have an entity reference, it is known as Aggregation.

-  Aggregation represents HAS-A relationship.

-  It is a unidirectional association i.e. a one-way relationship.

-  In Aggregation, both the entries can survive individually which means ending one entity will not affect the other entity.

Consider the class diagram

```
Student class
public class Student
{
public String name; // Student's name.
public double test1, test2, test3; // Grades on three tests.
public Student()
{
System.out.printin(â€œ Creating Student 1! *);
}
public double getAverage()
{ // compute average test grade
return (test1 + test2 + test3) / 3;
}

}// end of class Student
```
```
Course Class
public class Course{
private String courseName;
private int courselevel;
private final int courseCredits;
public Course (String courseName, int courselevel, int courseCredits )
{
this.courseNeme= courseName;
this.courselevel=courselevel;
this. courseCredits=courseCredits;

}
}
```
```
Course Registration
public class CourseRegistartion

{
private Course courseObj:
private Student studentObj;

public Course ( Course courseObj, Student studentObj)
{

 
this.courseObj
this. studentObj
}
}
```
Composition relationship:

Composition is a restricted form of Aggregation in which two entities are highly dependent on each other.

-  It represents part-of relationship.

-  In composition, both entities are dependent on each other.

-  When there is a composition between two entities, the composed object cannot exist without the other entity.

Composition is a strong Association whereas Aggregation is a weak Association.

Consider the following class diagram:
<br>

<center>
<img src="images\fig2.jpg">
</center>

<br>


The class diagram shows that the **Engine** is a part-of **Vehicle** and the **Vehicle** cannot exist without the **Engine** object. The **Engine object** cannot be changed once assigned to a **Vehicle**.

Use the final Keyword on the variable as a modifier. Using final means the value once assigned to a variable cannot be changed.
